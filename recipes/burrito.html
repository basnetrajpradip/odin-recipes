  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p>A burrito is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in Ciudad Juárez,
    consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various
    ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make
    it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 low carb whole wheat tortillas</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cream</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and white pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cumin powder</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons salsa, chunky style</li>
      <li>2 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the cream, salsa, cumin and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>In a non stick skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and then scramble the eggs.</li>
      <li>Just before they are set, add the cheese and fold-in until it begins to melt.</li>
      <li>Lay the tortillas on a flat surface. Divide the eggs equally between the two and place on the bottom third of each tortilla. </li>
      <li>Fold the bottom third over tucking in. Fold in the two sides and then roll up. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
